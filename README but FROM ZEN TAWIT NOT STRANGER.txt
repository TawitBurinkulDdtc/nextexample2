How to run this

Set up:
write      npm install     first???? 

Change terminal to cmd or use cmd
type    npx create-next-app@latest dt468example

After cd,   type d: to change to d (In in c:)



Running:

type       npm run dev


Then go to web browser and type http://localhost:3000/


I pretty sure about npm run dev and localhost:3000 of other setup stuff, i'm not sure cause I do it like 2 time.
But I do npm run dev and localhost:3000 like every day.




Also gotta do npm run dev in terminal that cmd too,I believe
